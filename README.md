> fastclean - Experiments to find incorrect labels in the dataset and noisy training


This file will become your README and also the index of your documentation.

## Notebooks

- 01 - Training using Noisy Imagenette with cleanlab to identify noisy labels & categorize them into High, Medium & Low confidence range. 
- 02 - Training MNIST with Label Smoothing & CleanLab
- 03 - Text Classification on Covid Tweets to identify the informativeness. Determine the noisy lavels even in the test dataset.
